Add a 'Context' with an API to track Mappings/Matching statuses
Sort mappings based on their cost (performance - regex/jsonPath cost more than an exact match for example)
Dynamicaly sort mappings during runtime based on most 'hit' (using the context info from context)?
Add more tests
Display differences when no match is found
Add delay option to response (normal distribution)
Remove americanas-go/log dependency
Possibly remove americanas-go/config dependency
APM/Metrics (Opentelemetry integration)
Performance tests
Improve/refactor validation
